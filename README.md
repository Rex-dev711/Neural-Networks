This repository is a collection of interesting and influential research papers on neural networks and deep learning. The goal is to curate high-quality papers that cover a wide range of topics, from foundational theories to cutting-edge advancements.

## Suggested Reading Order and Paper Description

1. Paper#1: [**"Introduction to artificial neural networks"** by Enzoi Grossi & Massimo Buscema] is an insightful intro to ANNs and their uses. It explains how ANNs, combined with EAs for optimized variable selection, recognize patterns, make predictions and solve non-linear problems, without going into any mathematics. Even a layman hearing the term 'ANN' for first time can read this paper and understand how ANNs work!

2. Paper#2: [**"Neocognitron"** by Kunihiko Fukushima] written in 1980, is the groundwork for the later development in CNNs. It didn't used any backpropagation, instead employed an unsupervised, self-organizing mechanism based on Hebbian learning and competitive learning. While it's not really necessary to read it, it's an interesting to know how the first position-invariant pattern recognition network, through self-organizing itself works, which later influenced the development of CNNs (LeCun) in 1980s, 1990s, & 2010s(DL)!

3. Paper#3: [**"Handwritten Digit Recognition with a Back-Propagation Network"** by LeCun, Boser, Denker, Hendwerson, Howard, Hubbard, Jackel] is an early network (1989) based on fully-connected (MLP) using back-propagation algorithm and was used in commercial Digital Signal Processor Board. It's also called LeNet-1, and later became the groundwork for CNNs!
